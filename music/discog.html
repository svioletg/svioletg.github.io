    <h1>discography</h1>
    <p>
        This is a list of everything I've released; singles, EPs, albums, anything. While things are mostly consistent,
        there are certain releases that were only on Bandcamp, or only on SoundCloud, and so on. This page will compile
        everything across <i>every</i> platform, as much as I can still find.
        This includes both original releases and remakes, remixes, covers, anything like that, which I was doing a lot more frequently early on.
        As a last bit of clarification, this is every <i>release</i>, not every individual <i>track</i>.
        <br><br>
        Each track will have its own page,
        which includes information on what was used in the track, and stems if they're available.
        Track pages also include whatever work-in-progress clips I had of the song before it was released.
        A few things to note;
        while I believe I still have every project file of what I've worked on, the older they get the more likely it is
        certain things like samples or VSTs I may have moved or deleted have rendered the project incomplete â€” or, they may just be corrupted somehow.
        Stems will only be available for tracks where I still have the project file for it in the state it was released in.
        <br><br>
        On the topic of older tracks, for the first couple years I was uploading things pretty much exclusively to SoundCloud,
        which has a total upload duration limit, and hides old tracks if you upload too many new ones and aren't subscribed. While I still have access
        to the actual tracks on my PC, this means I might be missing some release information like when I actually uploaded them.
        I actually considered renewing that subscription temporarily so I can see those old tracks and double check some stuff, but apparently
        their subscription model changed to only being billed yearly, so I'll have to pay $100 to do that, which I'm not doing. God, SoundCloud sucks these days.
        <br><br>
        The titles of each release are exactly how they appeared on either Bandcamp or SoundCloud - everything I released was on either one of those at the very least.
