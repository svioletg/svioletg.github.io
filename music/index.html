        I'm seth "violet" gibbs, and I've been writing & producing my own music since 2015 â€” though I only started <i>releasing</i> music in 2016.
        This site is meant as a sort of archival database of my work. I'll be providing as much information as I can about what was used in each track,
        anything of note regarding the writing or production process, and links to some resources as well, like stems.
