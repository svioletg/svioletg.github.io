		<h2>ARCHIVE</h2>
		<p>Here you will find a list of every previous server that's been hosted, along with a download of the last map backup before it was closed, and a gallery of screenshots/maps from that server.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you had played during any of these versions and have screenshots you'd like to add, let me know! (This is Violet, in case that wasn't clear)</p>
		<br>
		<p>Choose a gallery:</p>
