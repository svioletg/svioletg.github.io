		<p>As of <abbr title="May 22nd, 2022">right now</abbr>, there is no server currently being hosted. A new server typically goes up around each new major Minecraft version, and stays up for 1-2 months after on average.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Every new version uses the same address: <code>play.bcr-mc.xyz:25565</code>, so you won't have to change it Every time.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The last server was for <b>1.18: Caves & Cliffs</b>, and ran from December 1st, 2021 to January 29th, 2022.</p>
