        <h1>Python: An Unprofessional Introduction</h1>
        <h2 id="preamble">Preamble Or Something</h2>
        <p>
            I want to preface all of this by saying up-front, I am <i>not</i> a Python expert,
            and I don't write it in any sort of professional capacity — in other words, it's never been my job to write Python code,
            I've only learned and used it purely as a hobby and because programming fascinates me. Over the years I've written lots of
            miscellaneous scripts to automate or streamline certain tasks (which Python <i>excels</i> at), but as of writing the only "major"
            project I have running is <a href="https://github.com/svioletg/viMusBot">this music bot for Discord</a>.
            This isn't a perfect guide, and I'm certain it won't be comprehensive, but my primary goal here is to try and provide
            a straightforward introduction to the language and some programming fundamentals along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of folks agree that
            Python is a great starting language for those new to programming as a whole, and I completely agree — I tried to learn a
            number of different languages as a kid, but Python is the only one that actually stuck, partially because it just ended
            up being the most practically useful. That's for a number of reasons, and I'll try to get into them as we go along, but
            all that is to say my aim is to both teach Python itself, and use it to introduce and explain some fundamental, core concepts
            to programming as a whole — things present across almost all modern languages.
            <br><br>This page will serve as a general introduction to getting Python set up and ready for you to use, starting from scratch.

        <h2 id="installing">Installing Python</h2>
        <p>
            Most programming languages can't be <span id="natively" class="term">natively</span> read by your computer, so in most cases you'll have to install some software
            that can take the code you've written, and translate it into something your PC <i>can</i> read. Said software comes in different
            forms depending on the language in question, but Python uses what's called an <span class="kw">interpereter</span>. You can get that from here: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">https://www.python.org/downloads</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The yellow download button should automatically give you the installer you need for your operating system.
            The instructions to follow will be for Windows users, as that's what I run 95% of the time. As far as the Windows installer is concerned, upon opening it you'll want to make sure to check the box next to
            <b>"Add Python to PATH"</b>, or something similar. Frankly, I don't know why this isn't checked by default, but it's
            required if you want to run Python anywhere on your system. Otherwise, almost nothing I explain beyond this is going to work.
