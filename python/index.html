        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Python: An Unprofessional Introduction</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 0;">Seth "Violet" Gibbs</h3>
        <h2 id="preamble">Preamble Or Something</h2>
        <p>
            I want to preface all of this by saying up-front, I am <i>not</i> a Python expert,
            and I don't write it in any sort of professional capacity — in other words, it's never been my job to write Python code,
            I've only learned and used it purely as a hobby and because programming fascinates me. Over the years I've written lots of
            miscellaneous scripts to automate or streamline certain tasks (which Python <i>excels</i> at), but as of writing the only "major"
            project I have running is <a href="https://github.com/svioletg/viMusBot">this music bot for Discord</a>.
            This isn't a perfect guide, and I'm certain it won't be comprehensive, but my primary goal here is to try and provide
            a straightforward introduction to the language and some programming fundamentals along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of folks agree that
            Python is a great starting language for those new to programming as a whole, and I completely agree — I tried to learn a
            number of different languages as a kid, but Python is the only one that actually stuck, partially because it just ended
            up being the most practically useful. That's for a number of reasons, and I'll try to get into them as we go along, but
            all that is to say my aim is to both teach Python itself, and use it to introduce and explain some fundamental, core concepts
            to programming as a whole — things present across almost all modern languages.
            This page will serve as a general introduction to getting Python set up and ready for you to use, starting from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            One last thing before we continue, throughout this guide will be "Sidenotes" from me, which will look like highlighted boxes
            that can be opened or close by clicking on them. They contain <i>no</i> required information to follow this guide in general,
            they're just extra explanations for any who may be interested in further details about the subject. You can also view them
            as my excuse to go on tangents, which is inevitable when I start talking about this stuff. This paragraph itself could've
            been a sidenote.
        </p>

        <h2 id="installing">Installing Python</h2>
        <p>
            Most programming languages can't be read and executed by your computer by default, in most cases you'll have to install some software
            that can take the code you've written, and translate it into something your PC <i>can</i> read. Said software comes in different
            forms depending on the language in question, but Python uses what's called an <span class="kw">interpereter</span>.
            You can get the latest version of it from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">https://www.python.org/downloads</a>.
            As a general note, as of writing this the latest major version is Python 3.12, future versions shouldn't outdate this guide too much,
            but it could be something to keep in mind. I usually like keeping up with changes to new versions, so if I notice something that 
            could outdate this guide, I'll try and update it when I can.
        </p>
        <p>
            The yellow download button should automatically give you the installer you need for your operating system.
            The instructions to follow will be for <b>Windows</b> users, as that's what I run 95% of the time. As far as the Windows installer is concerned, upon opening it you'll want to make sure to check the box next to
            <b>"Add Python to PATH"</b>, or something similar. Frankly, I don't know why this isn't checked by default, but it's
            required if you want to run Python anywhere on your system. Otherwise, almost nothing I explain beyond this is going to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we'll verify that everything installed correctly. Almost every programming language, including Python, needs to be run from 
            a <span class="kw">command-line</span> interface in order to work. On Windows, you typically have the Command Prompt and PowerShell,
            I would suggest using the Command Prompt first. Searching for it in your start menu should bring it up, but alternatively
            you can also press your Windows key and <kbd>R</kbd> at the same time, which will open a "Run" dialog, type "cmd" into the text box,
            and then either click "OK" or hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, which will also open the Command Prompt.
        </p>

        <h2 class="using-cli">Using the Command Prompt</h2>
        <p>
            If you're not familiar with the Command Prompt or using <abbr title="CLI: Command-line Interface">CLI</abbr>s in general,
            I'll give a basic overview here. Here, you can use <span class="kw">commands</span> to perform a number of actions on your PC,
            like moving in and out of folders, managing files, and running scripts and programs. Commands are entirely text-based — in their most
            basic form, the first word you type is the command you want to run, and anything typed after it are called
            <span class="kw">arguments</span>, which modify the behavior and output of the command. These are separated by spaces,
            meaning most commands you'll find are either single words, or use underscores (<kbd>_</kbd>) or hyphens (<kbd>-</kbd>) 
            to subtitute for actual spaces. An example of this <span class="kw term">syntax</span> would be <code>cd C:\Users\Violet</code>,
            where <code>cd</code> is the command, and <code>C:\Users\Violet</code> is an argument — in this case, a file path that determines
            what directory you want to move into. Something to note is that, navigating a modern system, you'll inevitably <i>need</i> to reference
            paths or programs that contain spaces — in order to make sure the command prompt treats it as one single argument, just
            put double-quotes <kbd>" "</kbd> around what you need to. For example, <code>cd "C:\Program Files"</code>.
        </p>
            <button class="sidenote collapsible">Sidenote: What are commands, really?</button>
            <div class="sidenote collapsible">
                <p>
                    90% of the time, a "command" is actually just the name of a program somewhere on your PC. Those programs are EXE files,
                    but when using the command prompt, EXEs can be run just by typing their name — no <code>.exe</code> required.
                    When you type something into the command prompt and hit enter, assuming said file isn't already in the directory
                    you're currently residing in, it will search through something called your <span class="kw">PATH</span> to locate
                    a program with that name, a term you may remember from the Windows installer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PATH is what's called a system enviornment variable — I won't spend a lot of time getting into what that part means,
                    but as for the PATH itself, it's essentially a long list of <span class="kw">file paths</span> pointing to different 
                    folders — the folders in this list are what your system will search through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's how you're able to run certain commands or programs from the command prompt no matter what directory you're
                    currently in, and when you start writing scripts for yourself you may even want to add your own directories to the PATH
                    to have the same convenience. But for now, don't worry about it — the installer should have added all of the relevant
                    Python directories to your PATH already. If it didn't, well, that's what the next section is about to determine.
                </p>
            </div>
        <p>
            Besides the Python-specific commands that will be discussed shortly (I promise), there's a few basic commands 
            that will be useful to remember, as well as some basic terminology that I'll be using from here on out.
