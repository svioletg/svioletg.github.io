        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Violet, a hobbyist programmer who's been learning and using Python since I was a kid.
            I'm not a professional programmer in any sense and have no intention to be, and I'm probably not
            qualified to be writing a whole tutorial on this subject. I will be doing this regardless.
            Python is often listed among good programming languages for beginners, and as I started learning it
            as a beginner myself all those years ago, I would pretty strongly agree. I think it's a great way to
            get introduced to the concept of programming in general, and the language makes it fairly easy to jump
            right into making useful things, so I wanted to write a bit of a tutorial or essay or whatever you want to call it
            on mainly how to use Python, but also to try and give a better understanding of programming as a whole in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to write this so that it requires as little prerequisite programming or computer knowledge as possible,
            and I'll be explaining many things as I go, but there are some very common things that are going to come up
            as we continue that will be useful to get out of the way right now.
            Firstly, throughout these pages I'll be using the term "CLI" a lot, and the CLI is a very important and
            basic part to doing almost any coding at all. CLI stands for <b>command-line interface</b>, you're almost guaranteed
            to have one available to you on any major desktop operating system, like Windows, MacOS, or Linux (any distro of it).
            If you're on MacOS or a Linux distro, your CLI is likely a program named "Terminal". On Windows 11 you may also have
            a "Terminal" (or "Windows Terminal") app, which you should use; otherwise, you'll have a program named "Command Prompt"
             — this exists on basically every version of Windows. Technically Windows also has "PowerShell" as a CLI option,
            but using it won't provide any advantages as far as this tutorial is concerned—if you already use PowerShell then
            by all means keep doing so, but if that's the case probably arleady just skipped this section anyways.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting familiar with the CLI</h2>
        <p>
            <p class="aside">
                I'll be using the terms "CLI", "console", and "shell" interchangably, but will mostly stick to "CLI".
            </p>
            A command-line interface is called as such because it serves solely as an interface to receive and process written
            "commands" to carry out certain actions. What commands are available to you depends mostly on your operating system,
            but I'll be covering some basic ones that you'll need for our purposes. Regardless of operating system, you should
            the <code>cd</code> command available to you. This is used to change your <b>current working directory</b>
            (directories are the same as folders, the term "directory" is just more common in programming), letting you navigate
            around your filesystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll start by using Windows as an example — when you start your CLI, you should be able to
            start typing into it. The text to the left of where you're typing is the <b>path</b> to your current working directory,
            which is likely your user folder (e.g. <code>C:\Users\Violet</code>). The <code>&gt;</code> character at the end
            is not part of the path, rather it's simply a <b>prompt</b> to show where you can start typing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>cd</code> command is very basic and takes only one <b>argument</b>: a path to the directory you want to
            change into. This can be either <b>relative</b> or <b>absolute</b>. A path is <b>absolute</b> if it starts with
            the filesystem's <b>root</b> — on Windows, this a drive letter (like <code>C:</code>), and on MacOS or Linux, this is a forward slash
            (<code>/</code>). <b>Relative</b> paths are any that do <em>not</em> start with that root.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><code>C:\Users\Violet\Documents</code> is an absolute path in Windows</li>
                <li><code>/home/violet/Documents</code> is an absolute path in MacOS / Linux</li>
                <li><code>Documents/Important</code> is a relative path in any OS</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="aside">
                Note that directories are typically separated by <b>backslashes</b> (<code>\</code>) on Windows,
                but <b>forward slashes</b> (<code>/</code>) on MacOS / Linux.
                In most cases on modern versions of Windows, the forward slash should be accepted as well, but it's
                worth keeping in mind in case you're using Windows and run into any trouble regarding paths.
            </p>

            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            The other command I'll mention is used to list the contents of your current directory.
            For Windows, this is the <code>dir</code> command, while on MacOS and Linux, it's <code>ls</code>.

                and the <code>-a</code> argument is used to show hidden files. Both can be done at the same time by using
                <code>-la</code>.

        <p>With these explained, we can move on. Next up is installing Python itself.</p>
        <h2>Setting up Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python code can't be read natively by your computer — in order to run any Python code, you need to install
            Python's software like the interpreter and standard libraries.
            If you're on Linux, while Python may be available in your distro's package manager, I would heavily recommend using
            <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> to manage your Python installations. For Windows or MacOS users,
            you can download the latest installer from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python's official site</a>.
            If you <em>are</em> doing the latter, during the installation you may see a checkbox labelled something like
            "Add Python to PATH" — it's important to make sure this is checked.
        </p>
        <p class="aside">
            While there shouldn't be too many differences as long as you're using a version beginning with "3",
            the latest version as of writing is Python 3.13, so this tutorial is written with that in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll verify that Python was installed correctly. Open up your CLI, type <code>python</code> or <code>py</code>,
            and you should see something like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="code">
Python 3.12.8 (main, Jan 20 2025, 12:56:51) [GCC 11.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            When run like this with no arguments, the Python
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> will be opened.
            The REPL is an interactive console where you can write lines of Python and have them evaluated immediately,
            letting you experiment and test things out quickly. I won't focus too much on it right now since we haven't even
            discussed how to write Python yet, but keep it in mind as we continue. In order to actually run Python code, which
            is saved into files ending in a <code>.py</code> extension, just use the Python command followed by a path to a
            Python script file.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="code">
            python my_code.py
        </blockquote>
        <i>or</i>
        <blockquote class="code">
            py my_code.py
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            With Python ready to go, we'll start exploring some fundamentals of programming, and how to use them in Python.
